## About
SuperTokens is an advanced session management solution for web and mobile apps. It is different from most other
 solutions because it prevents all session related attacks, as well as detects session hijacking using rotating
  refresh tokens.

**Works with all web frameworks like NodeJS, Laravel etc.** Learn more at https://supertokens.io
